strange old man with a bad haircut
Wake up, young hero. 13 years have passed since the dreaded G-Thief took you captive in his terrible dungeon, using a very deep enchantment that put you into a deep sleep... among other things. I you know what I mean.
The sweet and peaceful land of Nital that you once knew is no more: the sound of the pure wind that runs through the valley has been replaced by the constant noise of the lamentations of women and children, tortured by the bandits in the pay of the terrible G-Thief, that resounds through all the walls of the imperial palace that overlooks the county...
Times are critical, young hero. Only you can retrieve from the G-Thief the stone of balance, the mysterious Gem! 
Hunker down, your time has come: in the darkest corners of this dungeon, you will have to face the G-Thief's bodyguard:
The five Cursed Skeletons, armed with their terrible plagues, the five Dawn Bringers of Death, good chara design but rather stupid, and finally, this cool guy who is the Mad Wizard... with fearsome spells.... bark bark
And after all these ordeals hero, finally you can take your revenge and kick the ass of that bastard G-Thier. 
Cheer up, hero!
The fate of Nital rests on your shoulders! Save the womans and the childen !
